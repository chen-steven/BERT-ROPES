For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\n\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

Using the crash prediction model for mid-block\nlocations, generic motorist and cyclist volumes can be used to demonstrate the impacts on the\nexpected crash rate of varying motor vehicle and cycle volumes. As shown in figure 2.20, an increase\nin the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at\nmid-block locations, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. That is to say, the crash rate per\ncyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases. ", "situation": "There were a lot of motorcycles on Interstate 15 last week.
